1. Overview
-----------

This package provides a  set of files to be used  to wrap Cyclone Scheme
interpreter executable  with the  GNU Readline  wrapper Rlwrap,  by Hans
Lub; it supports GNU+Linux systems.

  This package installs "ice", a Bourne shell script for Cyclone Scheme,
and a set of completion files.  The scripts will spawn "rlwrap" with the
appropriate configuration and executable.

  The scripts  are meant to be  installed in the "bin"  directory of the
user's  home,  while  the  completion files  are  concatenated,  sorted,
filtered for uniqueness and installed as:

   .cyclone_completions

in the user's home directory.

  The installation directories can be changed by modifying the variables
in the "Makefile".

  The "ice" script is automatically generated from the template "ice.in"
that is preprocessed by the "Makefile".  The template itself is meant to
be customised at will.


2. License
----------

The files in this directory are in the public domain.


3. Install
----------

The following rules are available:

  all		Build the scripts  from the templates; build
		the completions file.

  clean		Remove the script and completion files.

  install	Install the script and completion files.

  uninstall	Uninstall the script and completion files.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/cyclone-readline-wraps
